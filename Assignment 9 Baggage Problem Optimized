Description:

Tom is planning a trip. His luggage can hold at most M kg. He has N items weighing W1, W2, W3, ..., and Wn. 
The values of the items are V1, V2, V3, ..., and Vn. 

Please give the maximum value of the items he can take.

Constraints:

M ∈ [1, 200]

N ∈ [1, 30]

Input:

The first line includes two integers M and N, indicating the maximum capacity of the luggage and the number of items.

Lines 2 to N+1: each line contains two integers Wi, Vi, indicating the weight and the value of it. 

Output:

Print an integer indicating the maximum value of items he can take.

input:
10 4
2 1
3 3
4 5
7 9
output:
12
